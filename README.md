# SACR-Control-Interface
The SACR Control Interface is a Blender Addon meant to make the editing of SACR Easier. The script utilizes the same property bones which were originally used in R7.2 and older but changes the Custom Properties as well as uses some other properties in the Armature Data to create a new custom user interface with more functions and features packed into a more readable and maneagble package.

The script at this time cannot import SACR R8, in order for SACR R8 and the scipt to function property each must be installed separately: [SACR R8](https://github.com/SakuraSedaia/SACR-MC-Rig/tree/SACR-E8)

## WARNING
This Addon in it's current state is extremely experimental as I am still learning Python Development, and the addon along with it's own version of Development 8 are not intended for production use.
