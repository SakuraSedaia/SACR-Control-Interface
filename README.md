# Sakura's Rig GUI

The Rig GUI is a new project by Sakura Sedaia with the goal of enabling easier customization and configuration among my many rigs, while Version 1 only had support for SACR R7.2.1 Version 2 refactors the entire addon making extensive use of the auto-load feature from [JacquesLocke's Blender Development](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/blender_vscode) extension for Visual Studio Code to give the addon the ability to seamlessly add more rigs to the addon without much effort.

## Instructions

1. Download the Latest release of Sakura's Rig GUI Addon
2. Open Blender, and navigate to User Preferences > Addons
3. Open the Dropdown Arrow on the Top Right

5. Check Addon to ensure it is enabled
6. Download the appropriate Rig from [https://sakura-sedaia.com](https://sakura-sedaia.com/rigs.html)
