# SACR-Control-Interface

The SACR Control Panel is a series of scripts that allow for easier customization of SACR Rigs without having to select individual bones for the specific settings, allowing for the changes of different aspects of the rig with any bone of the rig selected.

For Revision 7, R7.2.1 is the first official version which supports the script, while R7.2.0 _can_ function, some features are missing and broken.
